# Bank-Management-Project
This is a simple Java program that implements a bank account management system.
The main class,"bank", creates a Scanner object, reads the name and customer ID from the user, creates an instance of the BankAccount class, and invokes its menu() method. 
The BankAccount class contains several methods to manage a bank account, such as deposit, withdraw, getPreviousTrans and menu. 
The menu method provides a simple interface for the user to interact with the bank account, allowing the user to perform actions such as checking the balance, depositing or withdrawing money, or viewing previous transactions. 
The program uses a do-while loop to keep presenting the menu to the user until the user chooses to exit.
